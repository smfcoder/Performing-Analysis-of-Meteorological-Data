# Dataset:
(https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset)
- The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006-04-01
00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016-09-09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in
the Northern Europe.

### Hypothesis to be tested:
- Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly
across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming

### conclusion:
 - No change in average humidity over the ten years from 2006 to 2016. Increase in average apparent temperature can be seen in the year 2009 then again it dropped in 2010 , then a slight increase in 2011 then a significant drop is observed in 2015 and again it increased in 2016.
